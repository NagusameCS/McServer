# McServer

**Cross-platform Minecraft server hosting with world sync and NAT traversal.**

McServer allows a group of friends to host and share a single persistent Minecraft Java Edition world. Any user can locally host the server, and players anywhere in the world can connect without port forwarding.

## Features

- **Multi-loader support**: Vanilla, Forge, and Fabric servers
- **World synchronization**: Uses GitHub as turn-based persistent storage
- **Lock mechanism**: Ensures only one host is active at any time
- **NAT traversal**: Players can connect without port forwarding (via playit.gg, ngrok, or Cloudflare)
- **Mod management**: Integrated mod support with compatibility checking
- **Automatic backups**: Versioned world backups with easy recovery
- **Web dashboard**: Real-time server status, player list, and controls
- **CLI interface**: Full command-line control

## Easy Start (Click and Run!)

```

### Server Types

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Vanilla** | Official Minecraft server | Simple multiplayer |
| **Forge** | Full mod support | Heavy modpacks |
| **Fabric** | Lightweight mods | Performance + mods |

### Mod Management

For Forge/Fabric servers:

1. Add mods to the `mods/` folder in your profile directory
2. McServer automatically checks compatibility
3. View mod list in the web dashboard or CLI

Compatibility checks:
- Loader type mismatch detection
- Minecraft version verification
- Duplicate mod detection
- Missing dependency warnings

## Configuration

### GitHub Sync

World data is synchronized using GitHub. When you start hosting:

1. McServer acquires a lock (prevents concurrent hosts)
2. Pulls the latest world from GitHub
3. Starts the Minecraft server
4. When you stop, pushes changes back to GitHub
5. Releases the lock

### NAT Traversal

McServer supports three tunnel providers:

| Provider | Free Tier | Setup |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **playit.gg** | Yes, unlimited | Auto-setup, no account needed |
| **ngrok** | Yes, limited | Requires account + token |
| **Cloudflare** | Yes | Requires account + tunnel setup |

Configure with:

```bash
mcserver config tunnel
```

### Backups

Automatic backups are created:
- Before every sync operation
- Every 30 minutes while running (configurable)
- Manually via CLI or dashboard

Restore from backup:

```bash
# List backups
mcserver backup list

# Restore specific backup
mcserver backup restore <backupId>
```

```

## Security

- GitHub tokens are encrypted using AES-256-GCM with a machine-specific key
- Web dashboard supports authentication with JWT tokens
- Role-based access control (owner, admin, member)

## Troubleshooting

### "Lock is held by another user"

Another user is currently hosting. Either:
- Wait for them to finish
- Contact them to release the lock
- Use `mcserver unlock` (emergency only, may cause data loss)

### "Java not found"

Install Java 17 or newer and ensure it's in your PATH.

### "Failed to connect to tunnel"

- Check your internet connection
- Try a different tunnel provider
- Ensure firewall isn't blocking the connection

### "Mod compatibility errors"

- Ensure all mods are for the correct Minecraft version
- Ensure all mods are for the correct loader (Forge vs Fabric)
- Check for duplicate mods
- Install missing dependencies

## Development

### Building from source

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Run in development
